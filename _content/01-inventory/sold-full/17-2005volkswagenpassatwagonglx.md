This 55K mile 2005 Volkswagen Passat GLX 4motion wagon is one of the lowest mile examples for sale in the country. It is the last year of the B5 generation Passat, which some would argue was the last true touring style Passat sport wagon.  If you value the sporting dynamics of an AWD German wagon over a cross-over or SUV, this is the Passat wagon for you.  The CarFax shows this is a 1-owner vehicle with no accidents or damage and all regularly scheduled maintenance performed.  It was always serviced at the VW dealer and all records since new are included with the sale.  

##Exterior
The paint is in excellent condition - it appears glossy all over and has no major dents or scratches. The glass on all six windows is in excellent condition with no chips or cracks. The tires were mounted in April of 2013 and have less than 10k miles on them, 75% tread remaining. 

##Interior
The leather seats and upholstery are in excellent condition with no holes or tears and very little wear. The original Volkswagen floor mats are included. The dash and door panels, as well as all interior trim are also in excellent condition. 

##Mechanical
All systems function as they should and nothing is broken or inoperative on this vehicle. It drives smoothly with no unusual sounds or vibrations. The transmission shifts as it should with no abnormal sounds or difficulty. The electrical system works as is should as well as all electrical components. The window motors and regulators all operate at normal speed with no unusual sounds. The serpentine belt was replaced in April of 2013 with 45k miles on the odometer.
