If you are a Toyota fan, this is the 4Runner you are looking for. 2002 was the last year of the venerable 3rd generation 4Runner. The last year of the classic form that spanned almost two decades. This 1-owner car was originally purchased from Boulder Toyota and has only 133,000 miles on the odometer. Good luck finding a 3rd gen 4Runner with fewer miles - and good luck finding one that isn’t Beige or Silver. The Stellar Pearl Blue color is striking, Toyota’s equivalent to BMW’s Laser Blue. I took pictures inside and outside to highlight the color. The two-tone black leather seats, steering wheel, and door trim over tan interior were a special order option that adds to the exclusive theme. It is nicely complimented with the Toyota tow package, roof rack, larger (post – 1999 facelift) running boards, daytime running lights, rear heater controls, multiple power outlets, and extensive SR5 options listed below.

This is one of the cleanest 4Runners for sale in Colorado. The paint is in excellent condition. It shines brilliantly with minimal pitting on the leading edge of the hood. The chrome and black-work are not UV faded and the headlight lenses are clear. The interior is nearly perfect. There are no rips or tears, the carpets are clean, and there are no odors. All switches work correctly as they should. All mechanical systems work correctly. The 5VZ-FE V6 engine pulls strong, there are no driveline vibrations or noises, and the tires have over 75% tread remaining.

The following items were replaced during my inspection per the Toyota Service Manual:

- Castrol Edge 5W-30 Synthetic Oil
- Toyota Oil Filter
- Toyota Electric Antenna 
- Toyota Valve Cover Gaskets, Intake Gaskets, and Washer Seals
- Toyota Spark Plugs
- Toyota Front Rotors
- Toyota Front Brake Pads
- OEM Grade Windshield
- Toyota Front Tow Hook Cover
- Toyota Passenger Side Turn Signal Lens
- Rain X Latitude Wiper Blades


<br>The original owner stated that the timing belt was done per the Toyota Maintenance schedule at 90,000 miles at the Toyota Dealer.  I inspected it when I did the valve cover and it showed no signs of cracking or dry-rot.

This is a turn key 4Runner that needs nothing.

2001 and 2002 model year 4Runners got a more advanced multi-mode 4-wheel drive system that allows shift on the fly engagement up to 62 miles per hour and can be left on all the time, unlike previous models.  It also got a center locking differential instead of a rear locking differential, 4-channel ABS and ActiveTrac system, which provides front and rear limited-slip capability and vehicle stability control (VSC). The VSC is fully defeatable by engaging the center-locking differential.  This technology makes the ’01 and ’02 the years of choice when searching for a 3rd gen 4Runner.
