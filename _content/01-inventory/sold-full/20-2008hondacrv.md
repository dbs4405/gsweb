This is one of the best CR-V's for sale on the Front Range. It is a one-owner, Colorado car with a clean Carfax with only 79,000 miles. The EX-L is loaded with options. The Metallic Royal Blue Pearl exterior over Grey Leather interior is a fantastic color combo. The tires are in excellent shape with 9/32" tread remaining. 
I am highly critical of our cars and try to describe every imperfection.

##Exterior
The vehicle is in excellent condition with only a few nicks and scratches consistent with age and mileage. 

There is a tiny dent (about the size of a quarter) in left front fender. 

The front bumper cover has been repainted; it is perfectly matched and is free of the pitting found on most CR-V's. 

The windshield is also free of any pitting.

##Interior
The interior is in great shape, no tears, rips, or smells. 

All accessories and functions work correctly.

##Mechanical 
All systems function as they should, and nothing is broken or inoperative on this vehicle.

The car drives perfectly with no unusual sounds or vibrations. 

The transmission shifts as it should with no abnormal sounds or difficulty. 

The electrical system and all electrical components work as they should. 

The window motors and regulators all operate at normal speed with no unusual sounds.

##Maintenance
The 75,000-mile service has just been completed per the Honda Maintenance Schedule using OEM Honda Fluids and Parts. Receipts are included with the sale. Included in this service were:

- Replace Coolant
- Replace Engine Oil
- Replace Engine Oil Filter
- Rotate Tires
- Inspect Front and Rear Brakes
- Check Parking Brake Adjustment
- Inspect Tie Rod Ends, Steering Gearbox, and Boots
- Inspect Suspension Components
- Inspect Driveshaft Boots
- Inspect Brake Hoses and Lines
- Check All Fluid Levels, Condition of Fluids, and Check for Leaks
- Inspect Cooling System Hoses and Connections
- Inspect Exhaust System
- Inspect Fuel Lines and Connections

In addition to the above items, I also preventatively replaced the rear differential fluid with Honda Dual Pump II fluid. Although not called for by the Maintenance schedule, this is important in extending the life of the rear differential clutch packs.
