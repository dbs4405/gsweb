  Bart, Alex,
  
  I spotted your website after your clean 333xi wagon was featured on Bring-a-Trailer.  I\'m writing to you because a friend and I are vetting a very similar business model for operation here in Dallas, TX.  We\'re a couple of professionals who are also car enthusiasts.  I\'m in the process of researching Online Merchandising solutions like those offered by Dealertrack Technologies but I also really like the clean design of your website.  If you don\'t mind, would you share with me what you used to create this site?
  
  Thanks in advance and good luck with the sale of your vehicles.
  
  Regards,
  Mike Darr
