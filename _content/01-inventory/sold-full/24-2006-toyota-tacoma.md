If you are looking for a clean, low mileage Tacoma this is it! This is a 1-owner Tacoma that was originally purchased at AutoNation Toyota in Centennial, Colorado. It’s got only 72,500 miles on the odometer and has a clean Carfax with no accidents. The Indigo Ink Pearl (Blue) color is striking and stands out against majority of Tacomas, which are white, black, or silver. It has all of the right packages for Colorado -- SR5, TRD Off-Road, and Factory Tow Package (see below for a full list of options). Best of all it’s a 6-Speed manual! I am a Tacoma fanatic and pick only the best vehicles to sell. This Tacoma is going to make someone very happy.

##Exterior
The low miles of this Tacoma show in its exterior. The paint is in excellent condition and shines brilliantly. The color-matched fenders and front bumper are a great feature of the TRD Off-Road package. There is no pitting on the bumper, grill, or hood. The windshield is also free of pitting and the factory tint is perfect. The chrome and black-work are not UV faded and the headlight lenses are clear. The wheels have no chips or curb rash. The TRD decals are not cracked or pealing. The inside of the pickup bed has minimal wear and all load securing hardware is present. The 110V / 400V AC power point works. The only imperfections I could find were light clear coat scratches on the driver door and a dent in the rear bumper on lower passenger side portion. The left front mud-flap was missing when the pictures were taken, but it will be replaced by OEM part before the sale is complete.

##Interior
The interior is also indicative of the low miles. There are no rips or tears, the carpets are clean, and there are no odors. All switches and accessories work correctly as they should, including the compass and outside air temperature gauge (which is a common failure). The leather wrapped steering wheel and shifter show minimal wear.

##Mechanical
I performed a complete inspection and did the 75,000-mile service (a few thousand miles early) using Toyota parts per the factory service manual. In addition to an oil change, the only items I found that needed replacing were the windshield wipers. The 1GR-FE V6 engine runs smoothly and pulls strong. There is no idler pulley noise when it’s cold (another common issue). The brake fluid and coolant are both very clean. When I drained the oil it was also very clean and still translucent. The 6-Speed manual shifts smoothly and the clutch engagement has zero slip. The 4-wheel drive system engages exactly as it should. The brake pads are at about 50% and the rotors are not warped. There are no driveline vibrations or noises and no front wheel bearing play. The Goodyear Wrangler tires have over 50% tread remaining. The TRD Off-Road Bilstein shocks are firm, yet compliant. The rear leaf springs do not squeak and show no signs of failure. They are included in a voluntary recall by Toyota for all 2005-2011 Tacomas, but Toyota has not implemented it yet due to parts availability. The buyer will be notified by Toyota when it is implemented.
